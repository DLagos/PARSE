                    Charlie Tuttle is a master of software engineering, web design, machine learning, and quantum theory after having trained under the senior faculty at MIT, Harvard, and Mr. Miyagi. After surpassing his mentors and achieving an IQ of 344, he was able to find a solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem and perfect cold fusion within a week, though he disposed of the results due to a fear that others might find his intellect intimidating. He went on to co-found Facebook, Tesla, and Bitcoin, later leaving this life behind to enjoy a nice quiet education in computer science at SFSU.
